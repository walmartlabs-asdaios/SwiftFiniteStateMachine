/**
 FSMState represents a single state in the state machine instance.

 Each instance has it's own set of optional closures that application code can use to
 prepare for or reject individual steps in the transition process.

 All of the closures are optional, if a particular one is nil, the state machine will simply
 move along to the next step in the process.

 Each event closure returns a value,
 
 - if an instance of ErrorType is returned, then the chain of events is interrupted
 and the final result of the transition will be a rejection with that same error.
 - if an instance of Promise is returned, then it will be inserted into the chain
 of promises used in the transition, and subsequent steps will be dependent on
 the fulfillment or rejection of that promise
 - if any other value is returned (including nil), then that value is passed to
 the next step in the process
